The data processor module handles the analysis of performance metrics:

```python
# Example implementation from utils/data_processor.py
def process_performance_data(data, athlete):
    """Process performance data for a specific athlete."""
    athlete_data = data[data['Athlete'] == athlete]
    metrics = [col for col in athlete_data.columns 
               if col not in ['Athlete', 'Date', 'Session']]
    
    # Calculate metrics
    avg_metrics = {metric: athlete_data[metric].mean() 
                  for metric in metrics}
    
    # Identify strengths and weaknesses
    strengths, weaknesses = identify_strengths_weaknesses(
        athlete_data, metrics)
    
    # Calculate trends
    trends = {metric: calculate_trend(athlete_data[metric]) 
             for metric in metrics}
    
    return {
        'avg_metrics': avg_metrics,
        'strengths': strengths,
        'weaknesses': weaknesses,
        'trends': trends
    }
```

#### Form Analysis Engine

The form analysis engine processes images and videos to analyze athletic technique:

```python
# Example implementation from utils/image_analyzer.py
def analyze_form(image):
    """Analyze athlete form from an image."""
    # Detect pose keypoints
    keypoints = detect_pose(image)
    
    # Analyze the keypoints
    analysis_results = analyze_keypoints(keypoints, image.shape)
    
    # Create annotated image
    annotated_image = annotate_image(image, keypoints, analysis_results)
    
    return analysis_results, annotated_image
```

#### RAG Knowledge System

The RAG system provides access to sports science information:

```python
# Example implementation from utils/rag_system.py
def query_knowledge_base(query, num_results=5):
    """Query the knowledge base for relevant information."""
    # Convert query to embedding
    query_embedding = get_embedding(query)
    
    # Search for similar documents
    distances, indices = kb_index.search(
        np.array([query_embedding]), num_results)
    
    # Get relevant documents
    relevant_docs = kb_data.iloc[indices[0]]
    
    # Generate answer
    answer = generate_answer(query, relevant_docs)
    
    # Format sources
    sources = relevant_docs['source'].tolist()
    
    return {
        'answer': answer,
        'sources': sources
    }
```

#### Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine generates personalized training plans:

```python
# Example implementation from utils/recommendation_engine.py
def generate_recommendations(performance_data=None, athlete=None, 
                           form_analysis=None):
    """Generate personalized training recommendations."""
    recommendations = {}
    
    # Generate recommendations from performance data
    if performance_data is not None and athlete is not None:
        perf_recs = _generate_performance_recommendations(
            performance_data, athlete)
        recommendations.update(perf_recs)
    
    # Generate recommendations from form analysis
    if form_analysis is not None:
        form_recs = _generate_form_recommendations(form_analysis)
        recommendations.update(form_recs)
    
    # Add general recommendations
    if not recommendations:
        gen_recs = _generate_general_recommendations()
        recommendations.update(gen_recs)
    
    return recommendations
```

#### Database Integration

The database module manages persistent storage:

```python
# Example implementation from utils/database.py
def get_athlete_performance_data(athlete_name):
    """Get all performance data for an athlete."""
    session = Session()
    
    # Get the athlete
    athlete = session.query(Athlete).filter_by(
        name=athlete_name).first()
    
    if not athlete:
        session.close()
        return pd.DataFrame()
    
    # Get all performance data for the athlete
    performance_data = session.query(PerformanceData).filter_by(
        athlete_id=athlete.id).all()
    
    # Create a DataFrame
    data_dict = {}
    dates = []
    
    for pd_entry in performance_data:
        dates.append(pd_entry.date)
        if pd_entry.metric_name not in data_dict:
            data_dict[pd_entry.metric_name] = []
        
        # Extend lists with None to match length
        while len(data_dict[pd_entry.metric_name]) < len(dates) - 1:
            data_dict[pd_entry.metric_name].append(None)
        
        # Add the value
        data_dict[pd_entry.metric_name].append(pd_entry.metric_value)
    
    # Create DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(data_dict)
    df['date'] = dates
    
    session.close()
    return df
```
